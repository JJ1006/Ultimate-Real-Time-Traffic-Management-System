<h1> To do </h1>
<p> 1. learn tkinter and stream a video from outputframes on the tkinter window. </p>
<p> 2. till now have created the program to extract frames from video , add count of vehicles in the detection zone in each frame and combine this collection of frames back to a video. </p>
<p> so now we have to make a program that counts the cars in the frames of live recording video and gives the continuous output of car count in the detection zone on the tkinter GUI window. </p>
